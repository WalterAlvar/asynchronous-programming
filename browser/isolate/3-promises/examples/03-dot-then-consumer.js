/* .then Consumer

  Promises are strange things:
    you can's use their values as with normal objects
    you can only use them inside of consumers
  so how can you use resolved values?
  You do this by calling a method on your promise and passing a callback
    yourPromise.then((resolvedValue) => console.log(resolvedValue));

  Super important! consumers are all asynchronous!
    The callback won't be used until AFTER the callstack has cleared
  what?
    your .catch callback will always be executed asynchronously like with setTimeout

log('= = = =  the call stack is empty  = = = ='); // 2
